title: The Design Behind Restaurant Menus

> There is now an entire industry known as "menu engineering", dedicated to designing menus that convey certain messages to customers, encouraging them to spend more and make them want to come back for a second helping.

According to [menu engineer][menu-engineers] Gregg Rapp of Palm Springs, California, a large chain can take up to 18 months to put out a menu for use.

Apparently, if the font itself is too elaborate, it can alter the way the food tastes. For example, [a study has shown][0] that by using a font that was difficult to read, a wine was liked more by drinkers than the same wine with a simpler font. Another study found [rounder typefaces][the-taste-of-typeface] to be associated with sweeter tastes, while angular fonts tend to convey salty, bitter, or sour tastes.
