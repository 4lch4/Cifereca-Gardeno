First off, welcome to my Digital Garden!

If this is your first time hearing of a Digital Garden, I find the following quote to be one of the best definitions/descriptions I've come across:

> A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public. Contrary to a blog, where articles and essays have a publication date and start decaying as soon as they are published, a digital garden is evergreen: digital gardeners keep on editing and refining their notes.

If you'd like more information, [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden][3] by [Maggie Appleton][4] was the article that initially got me started down this path.
