## New Notes

When it comes to creating a new note for the Digital Garden, there's a couple things to make sure are accounted for:

- [ ] Create the new Note file and fill it with information.
- [ ] Make sure the new Note file has front-matter with any related tags.
- [ ] Add a link to the new Note in the `nav` section of the `mkdocs.yml` file.
  - [ ] `- NoteName: notes/<path-to-file>.md`

## Plugins
