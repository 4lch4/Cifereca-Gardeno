# Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

VSCode is a free IDE provided by Microsoft and is my editor of choice when it comes to writing, editing, debugging, code. With a fresh install it's got a rather lightweight footprint but is missing some features that developers have come to know and love in an IDE, which is where extensions come in.

VSCode has an extremely active ecosystem for custom extensions that can help you solve damn near any problem you can imagine.

This section of my Digital Garden provides notes on how to use, customize, tune, etc., an installation of VSCode.
