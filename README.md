# @4lch4/knowledge-base

This project serves as a collection of my "public knowledge", which consists of just about everything I learn. I'm just starting this repository out so as of writing this, I only have a couple TILs and some cheatsheets I've collected over the years.

The actual website is [hosted here][KBA-Home] by [Vercel][Vercel-Home]. At some point I'll likely convert it so it runs on [GitHub Pages][GitHub-Pages] instead since that's what I use for my other SSG sites.
