As is with virtually _all_ of my "TILs," this one came from another [article I found online][0], this time while browsing HackerNews. This article is on what a Project Charter is and what kind of value it can serve for your new or existing projects.

So, what is a Project Charter?

> The project charter is a formal document that gives you a high-level overview of the entire project. Created before working on a project, it clearly defines the project scope along with other useful project details.

So, the way I see them at first is that they're a loosesly (or tightly) defined goal for the project and some other high-level info about the project:

- The reason why the team will be working on the project.
- The success criteria for the project (conditions that need to be met).
- The critical success factors of the project.
- The authority, roles, and responsibilities of the project manager.
- The budget of the project.

While my projects generally aren't going to have enough folks involved to really divide things, but it's still a good thing to consider.
