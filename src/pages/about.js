So, if you're on this page, you're likely unsure what the hell this site
is for, or you're just the curious type. No worries, it's my project and
I'm still not 100% sure what all will go here ðŸ˜…

        As I start this project on May 09, 2021, I personally see this project and website to be a
        collection of my "public knowledge", which simply means all of the things I learn or pick up
        around my travels on the internet. <a href="/tils/index">TIL snippets</a>,{' '}
        <a href="/cheatsheets/index">cheatsheets</a>, and eventually my blog posts that I've written
        in the past/future.

        I got the idea of "Learning in Public" from{' '}
        <a href="https://medium.com/my-learning-journal/why-you-should-learn-in-public-4fd3a6239549">
          a Medium post
        </a>{' '}
        by <a href="https://medium.com/@shuomi">Shu Omi</a>, which led me down the rabbit hole and
        resulted in this site being created. In short:
        <blockquote style={{ marginTop: '5%' }}>
          It simply means sharing what youâ€™re working on with other people. It might be your hobby,
          side project, or just random facts you learned.

        sure what that will look like at this point.
