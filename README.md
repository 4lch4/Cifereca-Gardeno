What's a Digital Garden and why do I have one? Well, I stumbled upon an article that discussed "Learning in Public" and how to use a Digital Garden to cultivate learning over time.

## Purpose

> **Question:** So, what's the actual purpose of this project?
>
> **Answer:** To put it simply and at risk of sounding lame, this site serves as my digital garden/tertiary brain. I understand that likely doesn't help much, so I'll try and explain in further detail below.

To expand on that, my personal goal with this **DG** is two-fold:

1. Serve as a landing page of sorts that contains all of my informative/valuable bits of information.
   1. This would be a combination of the tertiary brain and digital garden that I mentioned above.
   2. As I learn new things or relearn old things I've since forgotten, I'll add them here in a TIL, find, or something else I've not yet decided ðŸ˜…
   3. Ultimately, this makes it possible to do things like pull up the syntax of a command I used in the past.
2. Serve as a location where I can "learn in public."
   1. Learning in public is something I stumbled upon recently that clicks with me, so I want to do it more.
   2. To help understand what learning in public is, consider the following scenario:

### Not Learning in Public

> You're trying to learn how to create a website in React, so you use the create-react-app tool
> and build out a sample project.
>
> Once you finish the sample project, you either leave it on your PC or push it to a private
> repo and only ever look at it when you try and build a site with React again.
>
> At that point, you have to try and dig up the old project and hope it's not been so long
> that it's completely outdated.

### Learning in Public

> Now, take the above scenario and imagine you're doing it with the plan to "learn in public." Once
> you get to building the demo, you would make an effort to perform small commits that follow the
> [conventional commits specification][Conventional-Commits].
>
> Once you get the demo app working and in a good enough state that you'd be willing to show it to someone, you push the code to a public repository with your GitHub account. You add some extra files such as the `CONTRIBUTING.md` and some issue templates if someone manages to find a bug.

## Origin

One day I was browsing [dev.to][Dev-To] for stuff to read when I came across an article by [Josh Branchaud][JBranchaud] called ["The Digital Garden"][Digital-Garden]. This sent me down a rabbit hole of sorts that exposed me to not just the concept of a Digital Garden, maintaining an investment mindset, learning in public, and a few other things. Because of this rabbit hole, I have created this site and intend on growing it over a long period of time.

That said, the simplest way I can think of to describe this project is it serves as a collection of my "public knowledge," which consists of just about everything I learn. I'm just starting this repository out, so as of writing this, I only have a couple of TILs and some cheatsheets I've collected over the years.

## View Website

The actual website is [hosted here][Garden-Home] by [Vercel][Vercel-Home]. At some point, I'll likely convert it so it runs on [GitHub Pages][GitHub-Pages] instead since that's what I use for my other SSG sites.
